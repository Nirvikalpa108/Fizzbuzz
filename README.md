# Fizzbuzz

We have written Fizzbuzz using Test Driven Development (TDD). You can run the tests from the command line, following the setup and installation instructions below.

The classic Fizzbuzz does the following:
* For each multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For each multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
* For all other numbers, it prints the number itself.

## Setup 

Ensure you have installed [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) (a package manager framework for Ruby) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (a Ruby gem management gem).
